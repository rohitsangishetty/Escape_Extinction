## Game Instructions

The only controls for Escape Extinction are the left and right arrow keys, which move your character in either direction. You can also move past the boundary of the screen to quickly get to the other side.

The asteroids will fall at random and will fall faster as you progress. If you make contact with one, the game will end.

As soon as the game starts, you will be falling down onto the ground. During this short period of time, you will be immune to any asteroids you might happen to come into contact with.

## Thank you for playing!
My name is __Rohit Sangishetty__ and this game is my very first project. Prior to making this game, I did not know anything about Python or programming in general. I built up my current knowledge from scratch through self-teaching, and created this simple game to test what I learned. Thank you for playing and feel free to share this project with anyone you know!
